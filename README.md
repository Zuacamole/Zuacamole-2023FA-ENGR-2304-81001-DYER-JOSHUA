This repository showcases my progress in C programming throughout the course of a semester. By leveraging learning tools such as AI, along with guidance from professors and peers, I developed a series of advanced programs. These include:

A Tic Tac Toe game with both player-vs-player and player-vs-computer modes
File handling operations for reading and writing data
A program for converting numbers between binary, hexadecimal, and decimal formats
A matrix solver using Cramer's rule for linear equations
